        <br> 

    <h4>Hello everyone! My name is Taha, I am originally from Morocco. I started my professional career
        in 2016, after I graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer Forensics. I've held different positions
        in Fraud Analytics and Risk Mitigation. Until recently when work tasks got too repitive. I am glad I 
        have joined this bootcamp, as it made me more knowledgeable in the tech world, and looking forward to
        learning much more. 
        Outside of work and school, I am passionate about travelling, and have been lucky to do quite a bit
        of that in the past. That is why I wanted to build a travel website for my capstone. </h4>

    <h4>I invite all my classmates to connect with me on LinkedIn, I am sure we can all benefit from each others'
        resources, and eventually get a rewarding career after all this hard work!
